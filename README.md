# Advanced Statistical Methods and Optimization

This is the script for the lecture “Advanced Statistical Methods and Optimization” at the DIT/Campus Cham. 
I do realize, that this body of knowledge has been repeated over and over, but have decided to do my own nonetheless so I can add my own flavor to the realms of statistics. 
This work is heavily inspired by [Wickham and Grolemund 2016](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
