    "text": "1.1.1 Overview\nProbability theory is a fundamental concept in the field of statistics, serving as the foundation upon which many statistical methods and models are built.\n\n\n1.1.2 What is Probability?\nProbability is a mathematical concept that quantifies the uncertainty or randomness of events. It provides a way to measure the likelihood of different outcomes occurring in a given situation. In essence, probability is a numerical representation of our uncertainty.\n\n\n1.1.3 Basic Probability Terminology\n\nExperiment: An experiment is any process or procedure that results in an outcome. For example, rolling a fair six-sided die is an experiment.\nOutcome: An outcome is a possible result of an experiment. When rolling a die, the outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6.\nSample Space (S): The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a fair six-sided die, the sample space is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nEvent (E): An event is a specific subset of the sample space. It represents a particular set of outcomes that we are interested in. For instance, “rolling an even number” is an event for a six-sided die, which includes outcomes \\(\\{2, 4, 6\\}\\).\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Probability Notation\nIn probability theory, we use notation to represent various concepts:\n\nP(E): Probability of event E occurring.\nP(A and B): Probability of both events A and B occurring.\nP(A or B): Probability of either event A or event B occurring.\nP(E’): Probability of the complement of event E, which is the probability of E not occurring.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 The Fundamental Principles of Probability\nThere are two fundamental principles of probability:\n\nThe Addition Rule: It states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is given by the sum of their individual probabilities, provided that the events are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot both occur simultaneously).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(A \\; or \\; B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nThe Multiplication Rule: It states that the probability of both event A and event B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities, provided that the events are independent (i.e., the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(A \\; and\\;B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n1.1.6 Example: Rolling a Fair Six-Sided Die\nConsider rolling a fair six-sided die.\n\nSample Space (S): \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) (Figure 1.1)\nEvent A: Rolling an even number = \\(\\{2, 4, 6\\}\\) (Figure 1.1)\nEvent B: Rolling a number greater than \\(3 = \\{4, 5, 6\\}\\) (Figure 1.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: This example’s sample space, as well as event A and event B.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation of some probabilities:\n\nProbability of Event A (P(A)): \\(P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in A}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in S}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nProbability of Event B (P(B)): \\(P(B) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nProbability of both A and B (P(A and B)): 4 and 6 satisfy both A and B, \\(P(A\\;and\\;B) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\nThis example demonstrates the fundamental principles of probability and how they can be applied to real-world situations.\nIn the subsequent chapters of this course, more advanced concepts in probability theory will be explored, including conditional probability, random variables, probability distributions, and statistical inference.\n\n\n1.1.7 Population Definition\nIn the field of statistics, a population refers to the entire group or collection of individuals, objects, or events under study. For example, when conducting a survey to examine the average income of households in a country, the population encompasses all the households within that country.\n\n\n1.1.8 Random Sampling\nTo study a population, statisticians often employ random sampling techniques as it may not be feasible or practical to gather data from every member of the population. Probability principles come into play during the selection of a random sample, ensuring that the sampling process adheres to well-defined rules to represent the population adequately.\n\n\n1.1.9 Sampling Distribution\nOnce a random sample is acquired, probability theory becomes instrumental in analyzing and characterizing various sample statistics, such as the sample mean and variance. The sampling distribution serves as a probability distribution, encompassing all possible values of sample statistics attainable through random sampling.\n\n\n1.1.10 Inferential Statistics\nProbability plays a pivotal role in drawing conclusions about the population based on the data obtained from the sample. Statistical methodologies, including hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals, rely on probability theory to assess the likelihood of specific outcomes and quantify the associated uncertainty.\n\n\n1.1.11 Estimation\nProbability is a key element in parameter estimation. For instance, when estimating population parameters like the mean or variance based on a sample, statisticians employ probability distributions such as the t-distribution or chi-squared distribution to create confidence intervals and determine margins of error.\n\n\n1.1.12 Hypothesis Testing\nIn hypothesis testing, probability is employed to ascertain whether observed differences or associations in sample data hold statistical significance. Probability calculations aid in evaluating whether the observed results are likely to be a product of random chance or if they genuinely reflect characteristics of the population.\n\n\n1.1.13 Generalization\nThe primary objective of statistical analysis is to generalize findings from the sample to the entire population. Probability allows for quantifying the likelihood that the characteristics observed in the sample accurately represent the entire population, while also considering the inherent uncertainty associated with the sampling process.\n\n\n1.1.14 Probability in action - The Galton Board\nA Galton board, also known as a bean machine or a quincunx, is a mechanical device that demonstrates the principles of probability and the normal distribution. It was invented by Sir Francis Galton1 in the late 19th century. The Galton board consists of a vertical board with a series of pegs or nails arranged in triangular or hexagonal patterns.\nA Galton board, also known as a bean machine or a quincunx, is a mechanical device that demonstrates the principles of probability and the normal distribution. It was invented by Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century. The Galton board consists of a vertical board with a series of pegs or nails arranged in triangular or hexagonal patterns.\n\nInitial Release: At the top of the Galton board, a ball or particle is released. This ball can take one of two paths at each peg, either to the left or to the right. The decision at each peg is determined by chance, such as the flip of a coin or the roll of a die. This represents a random event.\nMultiple Trials: As the ball progresses downward, it encounters several pegs, each of which randomly directs it either left or right. The ball continues to bounce off pegs until it reaches the bottom.\nAccumulation: Over multiple trials or runs of the Galton board, you will notice that the balls accumulate in a pattern at the bottom. This pattern forms a bell-shaped curve, which is the hallmark of a normal distribution.\nNormal Distribution: The accumulation of balls at the bottom resembles the shape of a normal distribution curve. This means that the majority of balls will tend to accumulate in the center, forming the peak of the curve, while fewer balls will accumulate at the extreme left and right sides.\n\nThe Galton board is a visual representation of the central limit theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory. It demonstrates how random events, when repeated many times, tend to follow a normal distribution. This distribution is commonly observed in various natural phenomena and is essential in statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A Galton board in action.",

    "text": "1.4 Descriptive Statistics\nDescriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a data set. They provide a way to organize, present, and analyze data in a meaningful and concise manner. Descriptive statistics do not involve making inferences or drawing conclusions beyond the data that is being analyzed. Instead, they aim to provide a clear and accurate representation of the data set. Some common techniques and measures used in descriptive statistics include:\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency:\n\nMean (average)\nMedian (middle value)\nMode (most frequent value)\n\nMeasures of Variability or Dispersion:\n\nRange (difference between the maximum and minimum values)\nVariance (average of the squared differences from the mean)\nStandard Deviation (square root of the variance)\n\nFrequency Distributions:\n\nHistograms\nDensity plots\nFrequency tables\nBar charts\n\nSummary Statistics:\n\nPercentiles\nQuantiles\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Histogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: An example for descriptive statistics (histogramm)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example for descriptive statistics is shown in Figure 1.3 as a histogram. It shows data from a company that produces pharmaceutical syringes, taken from Ramalho (2021). During the production of those syringes, the so called barrel diameter is a critical parameter to the function of the syringe and therefore of special interest for the Quality Control.\nA histogram as shown in Figure 1.3 shows the data of 150 measurements during the QC. On the x-axis the barrel diameter is shown, while the count of each binned diameter is shown on the y-axis. The binning and of data is a crucial parameter for such a plot, because it already changes the appearance and width of the bars. Binning is a trade-off between visibility and readability.\n\n\n1.4.2 Density plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: An example for a density plot for the syringe data (barrel diameter).\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots are another way of displaying the statistical distribution of an underlying dataset. The biggest strength of those plots is, that no binning is necessary in order to show the data. The limitation of this kind of plot is the interpretability. An example of a density plot for the syringe data is shown in Figure 1.4. On the x-axis the syringe barrel diameter is shown (as in a histogram). The y-axis in contrast does not display the count of a binned category, but rather the Probability Density Function for the specific diameter. The grey area under the density curve depicts the probability of a syringe diameter to appear in the data. The complete area under the curve equals to \\(1\\) meaning that a certain diameter is sure to appear in the data.\n\n\n1.4.3 Boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: A boxplot of the same syringe data combined with the according histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very common to include and inspect measures of central tendency in the graphical depiction of data. A boxplot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a very common way of doing this. A boxplot is a graphical representation of a dataset’s distribution. It displays the following key statistics:\n\nMedian (middle value).\nQuartiles (\\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentiles), forming a box.\nMinimum and maximum values (whiskers).\nOutliers (data points significantly different from the rest).\n\nThe syringe data in boxplot form is shown in Figure 1.5 as an overlay of the histogram plot before. Boxplots are useful for quickly understanding the central tendency, spread, and presence of outliers in a dataset, making them a valuable tool in data analysis and visualization.\n\n\n1.4.4 Average, Standard deviation and Range\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: A histogram of the syringe data with mean, standard deviation and range.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery popular measures of central tendency include the average (mean) and the standard deviation (variance) of a dataset. The computed mean from an actual dataset is depicted with \\(\\bar{x}\\) and calculated via \\(\\eqref{mean}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\label{mean}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWith \\(n\\) being the number of datapoints and \\(x_i\\) being the datapoints. The mean is therefore the sum of all datapoints divided by the total number \\(n\\) of all datapoints. It is not to be confused with the true mean \\(\\mu_0\\) of a population.\nThe computed standard deviation from an actual dataset is depicted with \\(sd\\) and calculated via \\(\\eqref{sd}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nsd = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\label{sd}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe standard deviation can therefore be explained as the square root of the sum of all differences of each individual datapoints to the mean of a dataset divided by the number of datapoints. It is not to be confused with the true variance \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) of a population. The variance of a dataset can be calculatd via \\(\\eqref{var}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sigma = sd^2 \\label{var}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe range from an actual dataset is depicted with \\(r\\) and calculated via \\(\\eqref{range}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nr = \\max(x_i) - \\min(x_i) \\label{range}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe range can therefore be interpreted as the range from minimum to maximum in a dataset.",

The data is discretized and the information density is increased. As with every discretization comes also a loss of information. It is therefore strongly advised to choose the right tool for the job.\nIf the underlying distribution of the data is unknown, a good start to visualize groups within data is usually a boxplot as shown in Figure 1.7. The syringe data from Ramalho (2021) contains six different groups, one for every sample drawn. Each sample consists of 25 observations in total. On the x-axis the diameter in mm is shown, the y-axis depicts the sample number. The boxplots are then drawn as described above (median, \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentile box, \\(5^{th}\\) and \\(95^{th}\\) whisker). The \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentile box is also known as the Interquartile Range\n\n\n1.5.2 Mean and standard deviation plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Mean and standard deviation plots of the groups in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the data follows a normal distribution, showing the mean and standard deviation for each group is also very common. For the syringe dataset, this is shown in Figure 1.8. The plot follows the same logic as for the boxplots (x-axis-data, y-axis-data), but the data itself shows the mean with a \\(\\times\\)-symbol, as the length of the horizontal errorbars accords to \\(\\bar{x} \\pm sd(x)\\).\n\n\n1.5.3 Half-half plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Half-half plots that incooperate different types of plots\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots and mean-and-standard-deviation plots sometimes hide some details within the data, that may be of interest or simply important. Half-half plots, as shown in shown in Figure 1.9, incorporate different plot mechanisms. The left half shows a violin plot, which outlines the underlying distribution of the data using the PDF. This is very similar to a density plot. The right half shows the original data points and give the user a visible clue about the sample size in the data size. Note that the y-position of the points is jittered to counter overplotting. Details can be found in Tiedemann (2022).\n\n\n1.5.4 Ridgeline plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Ridgeline plots for distributions within groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10 shows so called ridgeline plots as explained in Wilke (2022). They are in essence density plots that use the y-axis to differentiate between the groups. On the x-axis the density of the underlying dataset is shown. More info on the creation of these plots and graphics is available in Wickham (2016) as well as “The R Graph Gallery – Help and Inspiration for r Charts” (2022).",

    "text": "1.6 The drive shaft exercise\n\n1.6.1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: The drive shaft specification.\n\n\n\n\n\nA drive shaft is a mechanical component used in various vehicles and machinery to transmit rotational power or torque from an engine or motor to the wheels or other driven components. It serves as a linkage between the power source and the driven part, allowing the transfer of energy to propel the vehicle or operate the machinery.\n\nMaterial Selection: Quality steel or aluminum alloys are chosen based on the specific application and requirements.\nCutting and Machining: The selected material is cut and machined to achieve the desired shape and size. Precision machining is crucial for balance and performance.\nWelding or Assembly: Multiple sections may be welded or assembled to achieve the required length. Proper welding techniques are used to maintain structural integrity.\nBalancing: Balancing is critical to minimize vibrations and ensure smooth operation. Counterweights are added or mass distribution is adjusted.\nSurface Treatment: Drive shafts are often coated or treated for corrosion resistance and durability. Common treatments include painting, plating, or applying protective coatings.\nQuality Control: Rigorous quality control measures are employed to meet specific standards and tolerances. This includes dimensional checks, material testing, and defect inspections.\nPackaging and Distribution: Once quality control is passed, drive shafts are packaged and prepared for distribution to manufacturers of vehicles or machinery.\n\nThe end diameter of a drive shaft is primarily determined by its torque capacity, length, and material selection. It needs to be designed to handle the maximum torque while maintaining structural integrity and flexibility as required by the specific application. For efficient load transfer, there are ball bearings mounted on the end diameter. Ball bearings at the end diameter of a drive shaft support its rotation, reducing friction. They handle axial and radial loads, need lubrication for longevity, and may include seals for protection. Proper alignment and maintenance are crucial for their performance and customization is possible to match specific requirements.\nThe end diameter of the drive shaft shall be \\(\\varnothing 12\\pm0.1mm\\) (see Figure 1.11). This example will haunt us the rest of this lecture.\n\n\n1.6.2 Visualizing all the Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The drive shaft data shown in a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The drive shaft data shown in a density plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: The raw data of the measured drive shaft diameter.\n\n\n\nFirst, some descriptive statistics of \\(N=500\\) produced drive shafts are shown in Table 1.1 (\\(\\bar{x}(sd), median(IQR)\\)). This first table does not tell us an awful lot about the sample, apart from the classic statistical measures of central tendency and spread.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: The summary table of the drive shaft data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN = 500\n1\n\n\n\n\ndiameter\n12.17 (0.51), 12.03 (0.58)\n\n\n\n1\nMean (SD), Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1.12 the data and the distribution thereof is visualized using different modalities. The complete drive shaft data is shown as a histogram (Figure 1.12 (a)) and as a density plot (Figure 1.12 (b)). A single boxplot is plotted over the histogram data in Figure 1.12 (a), providing a link to Table 1.1 (median and IQR). One important conclusion may be draw from those plots already: There may be more than one dataset hidden inside the data. We will explore this possibility further.\n\n\n1.6.3 Visualizing groups within the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The groups visualized as boxplots (including the specification)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The groups visualized as ridgeline plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: The raw data of the measured drive shaft diameter.\n\n\n\nFortunately for us, the groups that may be hidden within the data are marked in the orginal dataset and denoted as group0x. Unfortunately for us, it is not known (purely from the data) how these groups come about. Because we did get the dataset from a colleague, we need to investigate the creation of the dataset even further. This is an important point, for without knowledge about the history of the data, it is impossible or at least unadvisable to make valid statements about the data. We will go on with a table of summary statistics, see Table 1.2. Surprisingly, there are five groups hidden within the data, something we would no be able to spot from the raw data alone.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: The group summary table of the drive shaft data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN = 100\n1\n\n\n\n\ngroup01\n12.02 (0.11), 12.02 (0.16)\n\n\ngroup02\n12.36 (0.19), 12.34 (0.25)\n\n\ngroup03\n13.00 (0.10), 13.01 (0.13)\n\n\ngroup04\n11.49 (0.09), 11.49 (0.12)\n\n\ngroup05\n12.001 (0.026), 12.000 (0.030)\n\n\n\n1\nMean (SD), Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the table is good to have, but not as engagingi for ourself and our co-workers to look at. In order to make the data more approachable, we will use some techniques shown in Section 1.5.\nFirst in Figure 1.13 (a) the raw data points are shown as points with overlayed boxplots. On the x-axis the groups are depicted, while the Parameter of Interest (in this case the end diameter of the drive shaft) is shown on the y-axis. Because we are interested how the manufactured drive shafts behave with respect to the specification limit, the nominal value as well as the uppper and the lower specification limit is also shown in the plot as horizontal lines.\nIn Figure 1.13 (b) the data is shown as ridgeline density plots. On the x-axis the diameter is depiected, while the y-axis shows two types of data. First, the groups \\(1\\ldots5\\) are shown. For the individual groups, the probability is depicted as a line, therefore indicating which values are most probable in the given group. Again, because we are interested how the manufactured drive shafts behave .w.r.t the specification limit, the nominal value as well as the uppper and the lower specification limit is also shown in the plot as vertical lines.\n\n\n\n\nRamalho, Joao. 2021. industRial: Data, Functions and Support Materials from the Book \"industRial Data Science\". https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=industRial.\n\n\n“The R Graph Gallery – Help and Inspiration for r Charts.” 2022. https://r-graph-gallery.com/.\n\n\nTiedemann, Frederik. 2022.

These categories are distinct and non-numeric. For example, colors, types of fruits, or gender (male, female, other) are nominal data. Nominal data can be used for classification and grouping, but mathematical operations like addition or subtraction do not make sense in this context.\n\n\n2.1.2 Ordinal Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Some example for ordinal data.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal data represents categories that have a specific order or ranking. While the categories themselves may not have a consistent numeric difference between them, they can be arranged in a meaningful sequence. A common example of ordinal data is survey responses with options like “strongly agree,” “agree,” “neutral,” “disagree,” and “strongly disagree.” These categories indicate a level of agreement, but the differences between them may not be uniform or measurable.\n\n\n2.1.3 Discrete Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Some example for discrete data.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete data consists of distinct, separate values that can be counted and usually come in whole numbers.

Discrete data is often used in counting and can be represented as integers.\nOne quote in the literature about discrete data, shows how difficult the classification of data types can become (J.

    "text": "2.2 The Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: The standarized normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is a fundamental statistical concept that holds immense significance in the realms of engineering and production. It is often referred to as the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve, is a mathematical model that describes the distribution of data in various natural and human-made phenomena, see Johnson (1994). It forms a symmetrical curve when plotted, is centered around a mean (\\(\\mu_0\\)) and balanced on both sides (Figure 2.6). The spread or dispersion of the data points is characterized by \\(\\sigma_0^2\\). Those two parameters completley define the normal distribution. A remarkable property of the normal distribution is the empirical rule, which states that approximately \\(68\\%\\) of the data falls within one standard deviation from the mean, \\(95\\%\\) falls within two standard deviations, and \\(99.7\\%\\) falls within three standard deviations (Figure 2.6). The existence of the normal distribution in the real world is a result of the combination of several factors, including the principles of statistics and probability, the Central Limit Theorem, and the behavior of random processes in nature and society.\n\n2.2.1 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: The central limit theorem in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary reason for the existence of the normal distribution in many real-world datasets is the Central Limit Theorem (Taboga 2017). The CLT states that when you take a large enough number of random samples from any population, the distribution of the sample means will tend to follow a normal distribution, even if the original population distribution is not normal. This means that the normal distribution emerges as a statistical consequence of aggregating random data points. This is shown in Figure 2.7.\nFrom \\(n=10000\\) uniformly disitrbuted data points (the population) (\\(min=1, max = 100\\)) either \\(2,10,50\\) or \\(200\\) samples are taken randomly (the samples). For each of the samples the mean is calculated, resulting in \\(1000\\) mean values for each (\\(2,10,50\\) or \\(200\\)) sample size. In Figure 2.7 the results from this numerical study are shown. The larger the sample size, the closer the mean calculated \\(\\bar{x}\\)is to the population mean (\\(\\mu_0\\)). The effect is especially large on the standard deviation, resulting in a smaller standard deviation the larger the sample size is.\n\n\n2.2.2 Randomness and Independence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Two random and independent samples drawn from a normal distribution. They do not show any indepedence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nature and society, many processes involve a large number of random, independent, and additive factors. When these factors combine, their individual effects tend to follow a normal distribution, as predicted by the CLT. This principle is observed in various contexts, such as the behavior of particles in a gas (Brownian motion), the genetics of traits in populations, or the variability in the heights and weights of individuals in a population.\n\n\n2.2.3 Law of Large Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: The Law of Large Numbers in Action with die rolls as an example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Large Numbers states that as the size of a random sample increases, the sample average converges to the population mean. This law, along with the CLT, explains why the normal distribution frequently arises. When you take many small, independent, and identically distributed measurements and compute their averages, these averages tend to cluster around the true population mean, forming a normal distribution Johnson (1994).\nThe LLN ar work is shown in Figure 2.9. A fair six-sided die is rolled 1000 times and the running average of the roll results after each roll is calculated. The resulting line plot shows how the running average approaches the expected value of \\(3.5\\), which is the average of all possible outcomes of the die. The line in the plot represents the running average It fluctuates at the beginning but gradually converges toward the expected value of \\(3.5\\). To emphasize this convergence, a dashed line indicating the theoretical expected value which is essentially the expected value applied to each roll. This visualization demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the number of trials or rolls increases, the sample mean (running average in this case) approaches the population mean (expected value) with greater accuracy, showing the predictability and stability of random processes over a large number of observations.\n\n\n2.2.4 The drive shaft exercise - Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: The drive shaft data with the respective normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.10 the drive shaft data is shown for each group in a histogram. As an overlay, the respective normal distribution (with the groups \\(\\bar{x},sd\\)) is overlayed. If the data is normally distributed, is a different question.",

To answer the question, which of the values \\(x_i (i=1\\ldots5)\\) is more probable, the single data points are transformed to the respective z-score using \\(\\eqref{zscore}\\). In Figure 2.12, the z-scores for both groups are plotted against each other. The perfect correlation of the datapoints shows, that for every \\(x_i\\) the same probability applies.

The mean of the data (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is now centered at \\(0\\) and the standard deviation is \\(1\\). For this case, the specification limits have also been transferred to the respective z-score (even though they can not be interpreted as such anymore). For every \\(x_i\\) the probability to be within a normal distribution is now known. When comparing this to the transferred specification limits, it is clear to see that for group01 “most” of the data points are within the limits in contrast to group03 where none of the data points lies within the specification limits. When looking at group03 we see, that the nominal specification limit is -9.78 standard deviations away from the centered mean of the datapoints. The probability of a data point being located there is 6.8605273^{-23} which does not sound an awful lot. We will dwelve more into such investigation in another chapter, but this is a first step in the direction of inferential statistics.",

It is often used to test hypotheses about the independence of categorical variables.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe connection between the chi-squared distribution and sample variance holds significant importance in statistics.\n\nDistribution of Sample Variance: When calculating the sample variance from a dataset, it follows a chi-squared distribution. Specifically, for a random sample from a normally distributed population with mean \\(\\mu_0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_0^2\\), the sample variance (adjusted for bias) divided by \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) follows a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom, where \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nHypothesis Testing: In statistical analysis, hypothesis testing is a common technique for making inferences about populations using sample data. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution plays a crucial role in hypothesis testing, especially when comparing variances between samples.\n\n\\(\\chi^2\\) Test for Variance: The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is used to test whether the variance of a sample matches a hypothesized variance. This is applicable in various scenarios, such as quality control, to assess the consistency of a manufacturing process.\n\nConfidence Intervals: When estimating population parameters like population variance, it’s essential to establish confidence intervals. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution aids in constructing these intervals, allowing researchers to quantify the uncertainty associated with their parameter estimates.\nModel Assessment: In regression analysis, the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is related to the F-statistic, which assesses the overall significance of a regression model. It helps determine whether the regression model is a good fit for the data.\n\nIn summary, the link between the chi-squared distribution and sample variance is fundamental in statistical analysis. It empowers statisticians and analysts to make informed decisions about population parameters based on sample data and evaluate the validity of statistical models.

    "text": "2.8 t - Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: PDF of t-distribution with varying \\(dof\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-distribution, also known as the Student’s t-distribution (Student 1908), is a probability distribution that plays a significant role in statistics1. It is a symmetric distribution with a bell-shaped curve, similar to the normal distribution, but with heavier tails. The key significance of the t-distribution lies in its application to inferential statistics, particularly in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.\n\nSmall Sample Sizes: When dealing with small sample sizes (typically less than 30), the t-distribution is used to make inferences about population parameters, such as the mean. This is crucial because the normal distribution assumptions are often violated with small samples.\nAccounting for Variability: The t-distribution accounts for the variability inherent in small samples. It provides wider confidence intervals and more conservative hypothesis tests compared to the normal distribution, making it more suitable for situations where sample size is limited.\nDegrees of Freedom: The shape of the t-distribution is determined by a parameter called degrees of freedom (df). As the df increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. When df is small, the tails of the t-distribution are fatter, allowing for greater uncertainty in estimates.\n\nStatisticians found that if they took samples of a constant size from a normal population, computed a statistic called a t-score for each sample, and put those into a relative frequency distribution, the distribution would be the same for samples of the same size drawn from any normal population. The shape of this sampling distribution of t’s varies somewhat as sample size varies, but for any \\(n\\), it is always the same. For example, for samples of \\(5\\), \\(90\\%\\) of the samples have t-scores between \\(-1.943\\) and \\(+1.943\\), while for samples of \\(15\\), \\(90\\%\\) have t-scores between \\(\\pm 1.761\\). The bigger the samples, the narrower the range of scores that covers any particular proportion of the samples \\(\\eqref{tscore}\\) (Note the similarity to \\(\\eqref{zscore}\\)). Since the t-score is computed for every \\(x_i\\) the resulting sampling distribution is called the t-disitribution.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_o}{sd/\\sqrt{n}} \\label{tscore}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn Figure 2.19 it is shown, that with increasing \\(dof\\) (in this case sample size), the t-distribution approximates a normal distribution (gray area). Figure 2.19 also shows an example of the t-distribution in action. Of all possible samples with 9 \\(dof\\) \\(0.025\\;(2\\frac{1}{2}\\%)\\) of those samples would have t-scores greater than \\(2.262\\), and \\(.975\\;(97.5\\%)\\) would have t-scores less than \\(2.262\\). The advantage of the t-score and t-distribution is clearly visible. All these values can be computed from sampled data, the population can remain estimated \\(\\eqref{tscore}\\).\n\n2.8.1 The drive shaft exercise - t-Distribution\nThe t-score computation and the z-standardization look very familiar. While the z-score calculation needs some population parameters, the t-score calculation does not need such. It therefore allows us, to estimate population parameters based on a sample - a very frequent use case in statistics.\nSuppose we have some data (maybe the drive shaft exercise?) with which calculations can be done. First, the mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(sd\\) is calculated according to \\(\\eqref{mean}\\) and \\(\\eqref{sd}\\).

A value of \\(95\\%\\) is a common choice of cl.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nci &= 0.95 \\quad \\text{(for a 95\\% confidence level)}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThen the Standard Error (SE) is calculated using \\(\\eqref{se}\\), which takes the \\(sd\\) and \\(n\\) of a sample into account (notice, how we did not use any population estimation?).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nSE &= \\frac{sd}{\\sqrt{n}} \\label{se}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn the next step, the critical t-score is calculated using the cl as shown in \\(\\eqref{tscore}\\). qt in this case returns the value of the inverse cumulative function of the t-distribution given a certain random variable (or datapoint \\(x_i\\)) and \\(n-1\\) dof.

Why this is the case, is shown in Figure 2.20. In Figure 2.20 (a) the raw dataset is shown with the underlayed specification limits for the manufacturing of the drive shaft. For some groups the judgement if the drive shaft is wihtin specification is quite clear (group 1, group 2 and group 5). For the other groups, this can not be done so easily. For the drive shaft data, we of course now some population data, therefore the normal distribution can be compared to the t-distribution. This is done in Figure 2.20 (b). On the x-axis the diameter is shown, the y-axis depicts the groups (as before). The distribution on top of the estimated parameters is the population (normal distribution), the distribution on the bottom follow a t-distribution. With \\(n&gt;30\\) (as for this dataset), the difference between disitrbution is very small, further showcasing the use of the t-distribution (also see Figure 2.19 for comparison).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) the raw data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) normal disitribution, t-distribution and confidence intervalls using the t-distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: The drive shaft data and the application of the t-Distribution",

It assesses the ratio of two variances, indicating the extent to which the variability between groups or models is greater than the variability within those groups or models. The F-statistic plays a crucial role in hypothesis testing and model comparison.\nSignificance of F-statistics: The significance of the F-statistic lies in its ability to help researchers determine whether the differences between group means or the goodness-of-fit of a regression model are statistically significant. In ANOVA, a high F-statistic suggests that at least one group mean differs significantly from the others, while in regression analysis, it indicates whether the regression model as a whole is a good fit for the data.\nApplications of F-statistics: 1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): F-statistics are extensively used in ANOVA to compare means across two or more groups. It helps determine whether there are significant differences among the means of these groups. For example, an ANOVA might be used to compare the mean test scores of students taught using different teaching methods.\n\nRegression Analysis: F-statistics are used in regression analysis to assess the overall significance of a regression model. Specifically, in multiple linear regression, it helps determine whether the model, which includes multiple predictor variables, is better at explaining the variance in the response variable compared to a model with no predictors. It tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients of the model are equal to zero.\n\nThe degrees of freedom in an F-distribution refer to the two sets of numbers that determine the shape and properties of the distribution (Figure 2.21).\nNumerator Degrees of Freedom (\\(dof_1\\)): The numerator degrees of freedom, often denoted as \\(dof_1\\), is associated with the variability between groups or models in statistical analyses (Figure 2.21 (a) - horizontal axis). In the context of ANOVA, it represents the dof associated with the differences among group means. In regression analysis, it is related to the number of predictors or coefficients being tested simultaneously.\nDenominator Degrees of Freedom (\\(dof_2\\)): The denominator degrees of freedom, often denoted as \\(dof_2\\), is associated with the variability within groups or models (Figure 2.21 (b) - vertical axis). In ANOVA, it represents the degrees of freedom associated with the variability within each group. In regression analysis, it is related to the error or residual degrees of freedom, indicating the remaining variability not explained by the model.\nThe F-distribution is used to compare two variances: one from the numerator and the other from the denominator. The F-statistic, calculated as the ratio of these variances, follows an F-distribution \\(\\eqref{fdist}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(x; dof_1, dof_2) = \\frac{{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{{dof_1 + dof_2}}{2}\\right)}}{{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{{dof_1}}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{{dof_2}}{2}\\right)}} \\left(\\frac{{dof_1}}{{dof_2}}\\right)^{\\frac{{dof_1}}{2}} \\frac{{x^{\\frac{{dof_1}}{2} - 1}}}{{\\left(1 + \\frac{{dof_1}}{{dof_2}}x\\right)^{\\frac{{dof_1 + dof_2}}{2}}}} \\label{fdist} \\\\\nF_{m,n} = \\frac{\\chi^2_m/m}{\\chi^2_n/n}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn practical terms: A higher numerator degrees of freedom (\\(dof_1\\)) suggests that there are more groups or predictors being compared, which may result in larger F-statistic values. A higher denominator degrees of freedom (\\(dof_2\\)) implies that there is more data within each group or model, which may lead to smaller F-statistic values. The F-distribution is right-skewed and always positive. It has different shapes depending on the values of \\(dof_1\\) and \\(dof_2\\) (Figure 2.21 (b)). The exact shape is determined by these degrees of freedom and cannot be altered by changing sample sizes or data values (Figure 2.21 (b)). Researchers use F-distributions to conduct hypothesis tests, such as F-tests in ANOVA and F-tests in regression, to determine if there are significant differences between groups or if a regression model is statistically significant.\nIn summary, degrees of freedom in the F-distribution are critical in hypothesis testing and model comparisons. They help quantify the variability between and within groups or models, allowing statisticians to assess the significance of observed differences and make informed statistical decisions.",

A Bernoulli trial, named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli2, is a random experiment or trial with two possible outcomes: success and failure. These outcomes are typically labeled as \\(1\\) for success and \\(0\\) for failure. The key characteristics of a Bernoulli trial are:\n\nTwo Outcomes: There are only two possible outcomes in each trial, and they are mutually exclusive. For example, in a coin toss, the outcomes could be heads (success, represented as \\(1\\)) or tails (failure, represented as \\(0\\)).\nConstant Probability: The probability of success remains the same for each trial. This means that the likelihood of success and failure is consistent from one trial to the next.\nIndependence: Each trial is independent of others, meaning that the outcome of one trial does not influence the outcome of subsequent trials. For instance, the result of one coin toss doesn’t affect the result of the next coin toss.\n\nExamples of Bernoulli trials include:\n\nFlipping a coin (heads as success, tails as failure).\nRolling a die and checking if a specific number appears (the number as success, others as failure).\nTesting whether a manufactured product is defective or non-defective (defective as success, non-defective as failure).\n\nThe Bernoulli trial is the fundamental building block for many other probability distributions, including the binomial distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials.\n\n2.11.1 Probability Mass Function (PMF)\nThe probability mass function (PMF), also known as the discrete probability density function, is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics.\n\nDefinition: The PMF describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. In other words, the PMF assigns probabilities to each possible outcome of the random variable.\nFormal Representation: For a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where x represents a specific value. Mathematically, the PMF is defined as: \\(P(X = x) = \\text{{probability that }} X \\text{{ takes the value }} x\\)\nProperties: The probabilities associated with all hypothetical values must be non-negative and sum up to 1. Thinking of probability as “mass” helps avoid mistakes, as the total probability for all possible outcomes is conserved (similar to how physical mass is conserved).\nComparison with Probability Density Function (PDF): A PMF is specific to discrete random variables, while a PDF is associated with continuous random variables. Unlike a PDF, which requires integration over an interval, the PMF directly provides probabilities for individual values.\nMode: The value of the random variable with the largest probability mass is called the mode.\nMeasure-Theoretic Formulation: The PMF can be seen as a special case of more general measure-theoretic constructions. It relates to the distribution of a random variable and the probability density function with respect to the counting measure.\n\nThe PMF for the binomial distribution is given in \\(\\eqref{PMFbinom}\\)\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \\label{PMFbinom}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n2.11.2 The drive shaft exercise - Binomial Distribution\nIn the context of a drive shaft, you can think of it as a model for the number of defective drive shafts in a production batch. Each drive shaft is either good (success) or defective (failure).\nLet’s say you have a batch of 100 drive shafts, and the probability of any single drive shaft being defective is \\(0.05 (5\\%)\\). You want to find the probability of having a certain number of defective drive shafts in this batch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.24: The binomial disitribution and the drive shaft exercise.",

It is named after Wallodi Weibull3, who developed it in the mid-20th century (Weibull 1951).\nThe Weibull distribution is characterized by two parameters:\nShape Parameter (\\(\\beta\\)): This parameter determines the shape of the distribution curve and can take on values greater than 0. Depending on the value of \\(\\beta\\), the Weibull distribution can exhibit different behaviors:\nIf \\(\\beta &lt; 1\\), the distribution has a decreasing failure rate, indicating that the probability of an event occurring decreases over time. This is often associated with “infant mortality” or early-life failures. If \\(\\beta = 1\\), the distribution follows an exponential distribution with a constant failure rate over time. If \\(\\beta &gt; 1\\), the distribution has an increasing failure rate, suggesting that the event becomes more likely as time progresses. This is often associated with “wear-out” failures.\nScale Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)): This parameter represents a characteristic scale or location on the time axis. It influences the position of the distribution on the time axis. A larger \\(\\lambda\\) indicates that events are more likely to occur at later times.\nApplications: - Reliability Engineering: The Weibull distribution is extensively used in reliability engineering to assess the lifetime and failure characteristics of components and systems. Engineers can estimate the distribution parameters from data to predict product reliability, set warranty periods, and plan maintenance schedules.\n\nSurvival Analysis: In medical research and epidemiology, the Weibull distribution is employed to analyze survival data, such as time until the occurrence of a disease or death. It helps in modeling and understanding the progression of diseases and the effectiveness of treatments.\nEconomics and Finance: The Weibull distribution is used in finance to model the time between financial events, like market crashes or loan defaults. It can provide insights into risk assessment and portfolio management.\n\n\n2.12.1 The drive shaft exercise - Weibull distribution\nThe weibull distribution can be applied to estimate the probability of a part to fail after a given time. Suppose there have been \\(n=100\\) drive shafts produced. In order to assure that the assembled drive shaft would last during their service time, they have been tested in a test-stand that mimics the mission profile4 of the product. This process is called qualification and a big part of any product development (Meyna 2023). The measured hours are shown in Figure 2.26 in a histogram of the data. On the x-axis the Time to failureis shown, while the y-axis shows the number of parts that failed within the time. They histogram plot is overlayed with an empirical density plot as a solid line, as well as the theoretical distribution as a dotted line (Luckily, we know the distribution parameters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.26: The measured hours how long the drive shafts lasted in the test stand.",

It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson5.\nThe Poisson distribution is an applicable probability model in such situations under specific conditions:\n1. Independence: Events should occur independently of each other within the specified interval of time or space. This means that the occurrence of one event should not affect the likelihood of another event happening.\n2. Constant Rate: The average rate (lambda, denoted as \\(\\lambda\\)) at which events occur should be constant over the entire interval. In other words, the probability of an event occurring should be the same at any point in the interval.\n3. Discreteness: The events being counted must be discrete in nature. This means that they should be countable and should not take on continuous values.\n4. Rare Events: The Poisson distribution is most appropriate when the events are rare, meaning that the probability of more than one event occurring in an infinitesimally small interval is negligible. This assumption helps ensure that the distribution models infrequent events.\n5. Fixed Interval: The interval of time or space in which events are counted should be fixed and well-defined. It should not vary or be open-ended.\n6. Memorylessness: The Poisson distribution assumes that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of past events. In other words, it does not take into account the history of events beyond the current interval.\n7. Count Data: The Poisson distribution is most suitable for count data, where you are interested in the number of events that occur in a given interval.\nIn the context of a Poisson distribution, the parameter lambda (\\(\\lambda\\)) represents the average rate of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is a crucial parameter that helps define the shape and characteristics of the Poisson distribution.\nAverage Rate: \\(\\lambda\\) is a positive real number that represents the average or expected number of events that occur in the specified interval. It tells you, on average, how many events you would expect to observe in that interval.\nRate of Occurrence: \\(\\lambda\\) quantifies the rate at which events happen. A higher value of \\(\\lambda\\) indicates a higher rate of occurrence, while a lower value of \\(\\lambda\\) indicates a lower rate.\nShape of the Distribution: The value of \\(\\lambda\\) determines the shape of the Poisson distribution. Specifically:\nWhen \\(\\lambda\\) is small, the distribution is skewed to the right and is more concentrated toward zero (Figure 2.27). When \\(\\lambda\\) is moderate, the distribution approaches a symmetric bell shape (Figure 2.27). When \\(\\lambda\\) is large, the distribution becomes increasingly similar to a normal distribution(Figure 2.27).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.27: The poisson distribution with different \\(\\lambda\\) values.",

It is a valuable tool in inferential statistics and provides an estimate of how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nSE = \\frac{sd}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nA smaller standard error indicates that the sample mean is likely very close to the population mean, while a larger standard error suggests greater variability and less precision in estimating the population mean. Standard error is crucial when constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests, as it helps in assessing the reliability of sample statistics as estimates of population parameters.\nVariance vs. Standard Deviation: The standard error formula is based on the standard deviation of the sample, not the variance. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nScaling of Variability: The purpose of the standard error is to measure the variability or spread of sample means. The square root of the sample size reflects how that variability decreases as the sample size increases. When the sample size is larger, the sample mean is expected to be closer to the population mean, and the standard error becomes smaller to reflect this reduced variability.\nCentral Limit Theorem: The inclusion of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) in the standard error formula is closely tied to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) helps in this context to ensure that the standard error appropriately reflects the distribution’s properties.",

    "text": "4.3 Confidence Intervals\nA Confidence Interval is a statistical concept used to estimate a range of values within which a population parameter, such as a population mean or proportion, is likely to fall. It provides a way to express the uncertainty or variability in our sample data when making inferences about the population. In other words, it quantifies the level of confidence we have in our estimate of a population parameter.\nConfidence intervals are typically expressed as a range with an associated confidence level. The confidence level, often denoted as \\(1-\\alpha\\), represents the probability that the calculated interval contains the true population parameter. Common confidence levels include \\(90\\%\\), \\(95\\%\\), and \\(99\\%\\).\nThere are different ways of calculating CI.\n\nFor the population mean \\(\\mu_0\\) when the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) is known (\\(\\eqref{ci01}\\)).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nCI = \\bar{X} \\pm t \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{n}} \\label{ci01}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean.\n\\(Z\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., \\(1.96\\) for a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval).\n\\(\\sigma_0\\) is the populations standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\n2.For the population mean \\(\\mu_0\\) when the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma_0\\) is Unknown (t-confidence interval), see \\(\\eqref{ci02}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nCI = \\bar{X} \\pm t \\frac{sd}{\\sqrt{n}} \\label{ci02}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean.\n\\(t\\) is the critical value from the t-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\\(sd\\) is the sample standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\n\nFor a population proportion p, see \\(\\eqref{ci03}\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nCI = \\hat{p} \\pm Z \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\label{ci03}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion\n\\(Z\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\n\nThe method for calculating confidence intervals may vary depending on the estimated parameter.

We could say the effect was 25% but recall we had to transform the absolute difference in proportions to another quantity using the ES.h function. This is a crucial part of doing power analysis correctly: An effect size must be provided on the expected scale. Doing otherwise will produce wrong sample size and power calculations.\nWhen in doubt, Conventional Effect Sizes can be used. These are pre-determined effect sizes for “small”, “medium”, and “large” effects, see Cohen (2013).",

It represents the probability of obtaining test results as extreme or more extreme than the ones observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(p \\leq \\alpha\\)), you reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\) ( \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\) ), you fail to reject the null hypothesis. A common threshold for determining statistical significance is to reject the null hypothesis when \\(p\\leq\\alpha\\).\nThe p-value however does not give an assumption about the effect size, which can be quite insignificant (Nuzzo 2014). While the p-value therefore is the probability of accepting \\(H_a\\) as true, it is not a measure of magnitude or relative importance of an effect. Therefore the CI and the effect size should always be reported with a p-value. Some Researchers even claim that most of the research today is false (Ioannidis 2005). In practice, especially in the manufacturing industry, the p-value and its use is still popular. Before implementing any measures in a series production, those questions will be asked. The confident and reliable engineer asks them beforehand and is always his own greatest critique.",

It means failing to detect a significant effect or difference when one actually exists. The probability of committing a Type II error is denoted by the symbol \\(\\beta\\). Example: In a criminal trial, the null hypothesis might be that the defendant is innocent, but they are actually guilty. If the jury fails to find enough evidence to convict the guilty person, it is a Type II error.\nType I Error is falsely concluding, that there is an effect or difference when there is none (false positive).

As the risk of Type I errors is reduced by lowering the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), the risk of Type II errors (\\(\\beta\\)) is typically increased (Figure 4.7). This trade-off is inherent in hypothesis testing, and the choice of significance level depends on the specific goals and context of the study. Researchers often aim to strike a balance between these two types of errors based on the consequences and costs associated with each. This balance is a critical aspect of the design and interpretation of statistical tests.",

    "text": "4.11 Distribution Tests\nThe importance of testing for normality (or other distributions) lies in the fact that various statistical techniques, such as parametric tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA), are based on the assumption of for example normality. When data deviates significantly from a normal distribution, using these parametric methods can lead to incorrect conclusions and biased results. Therefore, it is essential to determine how a dataset is approximately distributed before applying such techniques.\nSeveral tests for normality are available, with the most common ones being the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the Anderson-Darling test. These tests provide a quantitative measure of how well the data conforms to a normal distribution.\nIn practice, it is important to interpret the results of these tests cautiously. Sometimes, a minor departure from normality may not affect the validity of parametric tests, especially when the sample size is large. In such cases, using non-parametric methods may be an alternative. However, in cases where normality assumptions are crucial, transformations of the data or choosing appropriate non-parametric tests may be necessary to ensure the reliability of statistical analyses.\nTests for normality do not free you from the burden of thinking for yourself.\n\n4.11.1 Quantile-Quantile plots\nQuantile-Quantile plots are a graphical tool used in statistics to assess whether a dataset follows a particular theoretical distribution, typically the normal distribution.

The x-coordinate of the point corresponds to the theoretical quantile, and the y-coordinate corresponds to the observed quantile from the data, see Figure 4.10.\n\n\n4.11.1.5 Perfect Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: A perfect normal distribution would be indicated if all points would fall on this straight line.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a perfect normal distribution, all the points would fall along a straight line at a 45-degree angle. If the data deviates from normality, the points may deviate from this line in specific ways, see Figure 4.11.\n\n\n4.11.1.6 Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The QQ line as plotted using the theoretical and sample quantiles.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviations from the straight line suggest departures from the assumed distribution. For example, if points curve upward, it indicates that the data has heavier tails than a normal distribution. If points curve downward, it suggests lighter tails. S-shaped curves or other patterns can reveal additional information about the data’s distribution. In Figure 4.12 the QQ-points are shown together with the respective QQ-line and a line of perfectly normal distributed points. Some deviations can be seen, but it is hard to judge, if the data is normally distributed or not.\n\n\n4.11.1.7 Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: The QQ plot with confidence bands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause it is hard to judge from Figure 4.12 if the points are normally distributed, it makes sense to get limits for normally disitrbuted points. This is shown in Figure 4.13. The gray area depicts the (\\(95\\%\\)) confidence bands for a normal distribution. All the points fall into the area, as well as the line. This shows, that the points are likely to be normally distributed.\n\n\n4.11.1.8 The drive shaft exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: The QQ plots for each drive shaft group shown in subplots.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQ plot method is extended to the drive shaft exercise in Figure 4.14. In each subplot the plot for the respective group is shown together with the QQ-points, the QQ-line and the respective confidence bands. The scaling for each plot is different to enhance visibility of every subplot. A line for the perfect normal distribution is also shown in solid linestyle. From group \\(1 \\ldots 4\\) all points fall into the QQ confidence bands. Group05 differs however. The points from visible categories, which is a strong indicator, that the measurement system may be to inaccurate.\n\n\n\n4.11.2 Quantitative Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: A visualisation of the KS test using the 10 datapoints from before\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, often referred to as the KS test, is a statistical test used to assess whether a dataset follows a normal distribution. It evaluates how closely the cumulative distribution function of the dataset matches the expected CDF of a normal distribution.\n\nNull Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis in the KS test states that the sample data follows a normal distribution.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): The alternative hypothesis suggests that the sample data significantly deviates from a normal distribution.\nTest Statistic (D): The KS test calculates a test statistic, denoted as D which measures the maximum vertical difference between the empirical CDF of the data and the theoretical CDF of a normal distribution. It quantifies how far the observed data diverges from the expected normal distribution. A visualization of the KS-test is shown in Figure 4.15. The red line denotes a perfect normal distribution, whereas the step function shows the empirical CDF of the data itself.\nCritical Value: To assess the significance of D, a critical value is determined based on the sample size and the chosen significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)). If D exceeds the critical value, it indicates that the dataset deviates significantly from a normal distribution.\nDecision: If D is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is concluded that the data is not normally distributed. If D is less than or equal to the critical value, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the data may follow a normal distribution.\n\nIt is important to note that the KS test is sensitive to departures from normality in both tails of the distribution. There are other normality tests, like the Shapiro-Wilk test and Anderson-Darling test, which may be more suitable in certain situations. Researchers typically choose the most appropriate test based on the characteristics of their data and the assumptions they want to test.\n\n\n4.11.3 Expanding to non-normal disitributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) the QQ-plot for the weibull distribution using the drive shaft failure time data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) a detrended QQ-plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: The QQ-plot can easily be extended to non-normal distributions.\n\n\n\nThe QQ-plot can easily be extended to non-normal disitributions as well.

In Figure 4.16 (b) a detrended QQ-plot is shown in order to account for visual bias. It is of course known, that the data follows a weibull disitribution with a shape parameter \\(\\beta=2\\) and a scale parameter \\(\\lambda = 500\\), but such distributional parameters can also be estimated (Delignette-Muller and Dutang 2015).",

It relies on the assumption of normal distribution, making it applicable when assessing whether a sample’s mean differs significantly from a specified population mean.\nThe test can be applied in various settings. One is, to test if measured data comes from a population with a certain mean (for exampe a test against a specification). To show the application, the drive shaft data is employed. In Table 4.9 the per group summarised data of the dirve shaft data is shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.9: The raw data for the one sample t-test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nmean_diameter\nsd_diameter\n\n\n\n\ngroup01\n12.015\n0.111\n\n\ngroup02\n12.364\n0.189\n\n\ngroup03\n13.002\n0.102\n\n\ngroup04\n11.486\n0.094\n\n\ngroup05\n12.001\n0.026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important prerequisite for the One sample t-test normally distributed data. For this, graphical and numerical methods have been introduced in previous chapters. First, a classic QQ-plot is created for every group (see Figure 4.18). From a first glance, the data appears to be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: The qq-plot for the drive shaft data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more quantitative approach to tests for normality is shown in Table 4.10. Here, each group is tested with the KS-test for normality. H0 is accepted (the data is normal distributed) because the computed p-value is larger than the significance level (\\(\\alpha  = 0.05\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.10: The results for the one KS normality test for each group.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\ngroup01\n0.048\n0.975\nAsymptoticone-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnovtest\ntwo-sided\n\n\ngroup02\n0.067\n0.754\nAsymptoticone-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnovtest\ntwo-sided\n\n\ngroup03\n0.075\n0.633\nAsymptoticone-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnovtest\ntwo-sided\n\n\ngroup04\n0.060\n0.862\nAsymptoticone-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnovtest\ntwo-sided\n\n\ngroup05\n0.127\n0.081\nAsymptoticone-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnovtest\ntwo-sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to assume normal distributed data within each group.

It is used to evaluate whether a sample’s median significantly differs from a specified population median.\nThe wear and tear of drive shafts can occur due to various factors related to the vehicle’s operation and maintenance. Some common causes include:\n\nNormal Usage: Over time, the drive shaft undergoes stress and strain during regular driving. This can lead to gradual wear on components, especially if the vehicle is frequently used.\nMisalignment: Improper alignment of the drive shaft can result in uneven distribution of forces, causing accelerated wear. This misalignment may stem from issues with the suspension system or other related components.\nLack of Lubrication: Inadequate lubrication of the drive shaft joints and bearings can lead to increased friction, accelerating wear. Regular maintenance, including proper lubrication, is essential to mitigate this factor.\nContamination: Exposure to dirt, debris, and water can contribute to the degradation of drive shaft components. Contaminants can infiltrate joints and bearings, causing abrasive damage over time.\nVibration and Imbalance: Excessive vibration or imbalance in the drive shaft can lead to increased stress on its components. This may result from issues with the balance of the rotating parts or damage to the shaft itself.\nExtreme Operating Conditions: Harsh driving conditions, such as off-road terrain or constant heavy loads, can accelerate wear on the drive shaft. The components may be subjected to higher levels of stress than they were designed for, leading to premature wear and tear.\n\nThe wear and tear because o the reasons above can be rated on a scale with discrete values from \\(1 \\ldots 5\\) with \\(2\\) being the reference value. It is therefore interesting, if the wear and tear rating of \\(n=100\\) drive shafts per group differs significantly from the reference value \\(2\\). Because we are dealing with discrete data, the one sample t-test can not be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: The wear and tear rating data histograms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.12: The results for the one sample Wilcoxon test for every group against the reference value.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nstatistic\np.value\nalternative\n\n\n\n\ngroup01\n3,208.500\n0.000\ngreater\n\n\ngroup02\n5,050.000\n0.000\ngreater\n\n\ngroup03\n0.000\n1.000\ngreater\n\n\ngroup04\n3,203.500\n0.000\ngreater\n\n\ngroup05\n3,003.000\n0.000\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.13: The results for the one sample t-test compared to the results of a one sample Wilcoxon test.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nt_tidy_p.value\nwilcox_tidy_p.value\n\n\n\n\ngroup01\n0.167\n0.182\n\n\ngroup02\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\ngroup03\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\ngroup04\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\ngroup05\n0.677\n0.803",

It organizes data into rows and columns to show the frequency or relationship between two or more categorical variables. Each cell in the table represents the count or frequency of occurrences that fall into a specific combination of categories for the variables being analyzed.

In the context of engineering sciences the application of ANOVA include:\n\nExperimental Design and Analysis: Engineers often conduct experiments to optimize processes, test materials, or evaluate designs. ANOVA aids in analyzing these experiments by assessing the effects of various factors (like temperature, pressure, or material composition) on the performance of systems or products. It helps identify significant factors and their interactions to improve engineering processes.\nProduct Testing and Reliability: Engineers use ANOVA to compare the performance of products manufactured under different conditions or using different materials. This analysis helps ensure product reliability by identifying which factors significantly impact product quality, durability, or functionality.\nProcess Control and Improvement: ANOVA plays a crucial role in quality control and process improvement within engineering. It helps identify variations in manufacturing processes, such as assessing the impact of machine settings or production methods on product quality. By understanding these variations, engineers can make informed decisions to optimize processes and minimize defects.\nSupply Chain and Logistics: In engineering logistics and supply chain management, ANOVA aids in analyzing the performance of different suppliers or transportation methods. It helps assess variations in delivery times, costs, or product quality across various suppliers or logistical approaches.\nSimulation and Modeling: In computational engineering, ANOVA is used to analyze the outputs of simulations or models. It helps understand the significance of different input variables on the output, enabling engineers to refine models and simulations for more accurate predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.35: The basic idea of an ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross such fields ANOVA is often used to:\nComparing Means: ANOVA is employed when comparing means between three or more groups. It assesses whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of these groups. For instance, in an experiment testing the effect of different fertilizers on plant growth, ANOVA can determine if there’s a significant difference in growth rates among the groups treated with various fertilizers.\nModeling Dependencies: ANOVA can be extended to model dependencies among variables in more complex designs. For instance, in factorial ANOVA, it’s used to study the interaction effects among multiple independent variables on a dependent variable. This allows researchers to understand how different factors might interact to influence an outcome.\nMeasurement System Analysis (MSA): ANOVA is integral in MSA to evaluate the variation contributed by different components of a measurement system. In assessing the reliability and consistency of measurement instruments or processes, ANOVA helps in dissecting the total variance into components attributed to equipment variation, operator variability, and measurement error.\nAs with statistical tests before, the applicability of the ANOVA depends on various factors.\n\n4.15.1.1 Sum of squared error (SSE)\nThe sum of squared errors is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a model to its data. It is calculated by squaring the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model for each data point, then summing up these squared differences. The SSE indicates the total variability or dispersion of the observed data points around the fitted regression line or model. Lower SSE values generally indicate a better fit of the model to the data.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nSSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\label{sse}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.36: A graphical depiction of the SSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.15.1.2 Mean squared error (MSE)\nThe mean squared error is a measure used to assess the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values in a dataset. It is frequently employed in regression analysis to evaluate the accuracy of a predictive model. The MSE is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between predicted values and observed values. A lower MSE indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values, reflecting better accuracy.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nMSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\label{mse}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n4.15.2 One-way ANOVA\nThe one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used for continuous data with three or more independent groups. It assesses whether there are significant differences in means among these groups, assuming a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis: True mean difference is equal to 0.\nPrerequisites:\n\nequal variances\nNumber of groups \\(&gt;2\\)\nOne response, one predictor variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.37: The basic idea of a One-way ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important prerequisite for a One-way ANOVA are equal variances. Because there are more than two groups, the Bartlett test (as introduced in Section 4.14.1.2) is chosen (data is normally distributed).\n\n\n\n    Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  diameter by group\nBartlett's K-squared = 275.61, df = 4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\n\n\nBecause \\(p&lt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) the variances are different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.38: The groups with equal variance are highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  diameter by group\nBartlett's K-squared = 2.7239, df = 2, p-value = 0.2562\n\n\n\n\nWith \\(p&gt;\\alpha=0.05\\) \\(H_0\\) is accepted, the variances of group01, group02 and group03 are equal.\n\n\nOf course, many software package provide an automated way of performing a One-way ANOVA, but the first will be explained in detail. The general model for a One-way ANOVA is shown in \\(\\eqref{onewayanova}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY \\sim X + \\epsilon \\label{onewayanova}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(H_0\\): All population means are equal.\n\\(H_a\\): Not all population means are equal.\n\nFor a One-way ANOVA the predictor variable \\(X\\) is the mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) of all datapoints \\(x_i\\).\n\n\nFirst the SSE and the MSE is calculated for the complete model (\\(H_a\\) is true), see Table 4.16. The complete model means, that every mean, for every group is calculated and the \\(SSE\\) according to \\(\\eqref{sse}\\) is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.39: Computation of error for the complete model (mean per group as model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.40: Computation of error for the reduced model (overall mean as model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.16: The SSE and MSE for the complete model.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nsse\ndf\nn\np\nmse\n\n\n\n\n3.150\n297.000\n300.000\n3.000\n0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the SSE and the MSE is calculated for the reduced model (\\(H_0\\) is true). In the reduced model, the mean is not calculated per group, the overall mean is calculated (results in Table 4.17).\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.17: The SSE and MSE from the reduced model.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nsse\ndf\nn\np\nmse\n\n\n\n\n121.506\n299.000\n300.000\n1.000\n0.406\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(SSE\\), \\(df\\) and \\(MSE\\) explained by the complete model are calculated:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nSSE_{explained} &= SSE_{reduced}-SSE_{complete} = 118.36 \\\\\ndf_{explained} &= df_{reduced} - df_{complete} = 2 \\\\\nMSE_{explained} &= \\frac{SSE_{explained}}{df_{explained}} = 59.18\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe ratio of the variance (MSE) as explained by the complete model to the reduced model is then calculated. The probability of this statistic is afterwards calculated (if \\(H_0\\) is true).\n\n\n[1] 2.762026e-236\n\n\nThe probability of a F-statistic with \\(pf = 5579.207\\) is \\(0\\).\n\n\nA crosscheck with a automated solution (aov-function) yields the results shown in Table 4.18.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.18: The ANOVA results from the aov function.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\ngroup\n2.000\n118.356\n59.178\n5,579.207\n0.000\n\n\nResiduals\n297.000\n3.150\n0.011\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome sanity checks are of course required to ensure the validity of the results. First, the variance of the residuals must be equal along the groups (see Figure 4.41).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.41: The variances of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the residuals from the model must be normally distributed (see Figure 4.42).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.42: The distribution of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model seems to be valid (equal variances of residuals, normal distributed residuals).\nWith \\(p&lt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) \\(H_0\\) can be rejected, the means come from different populations.\n\n\n\n\n4.15.3 Welch ANOVA\nWelch ANOVA: Similar to one-way ANOVA, the Welch ANOVA is employed when there are unequal variances between the groups being compared. It relaxes the assumption of equal variances, making it suitable for situations where variance heterogeneity exists.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis: True mean difference is not equal to 0.\nPrerequisites:\n\nNumber of groups \\(&gt;2\\)\nOne response, one predictor variable\n\n\n\n\nThe Welch ANOVA drops the prerequisite of equal variances in groups.

It is used to evaluate whether there are significant differences in medians among three or more independent groups.\nIn this example the drive strength is measured using three-point bending. Three different methods are employed to increase the strength of the drive shaft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.43: The mechanical Background for a three-point bending test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod A: baseline material\nMethod B: different geometry\nMethod C: different material\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.44 the raw drive shaft strength data for Method A, B and C is shown. At first glance, the data does not appear to be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.44: The raw data from the drive shaft strength testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.45 the visual test for normal distribution is performed. The data does not appear to be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.45: The qq-plot for the drive shaft strength testing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is then carried out. With \\(p&lt; \\alpha = 0.05\\) it is shown, that the groups come from populations with different means. The next step is to find which of the groups are different using a post-hoc analysis.\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  strength by group\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 107.65, df = 2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis Test (as the ANOVA) can only tell you, if there is a signifcant difference between the groups, not what groups are different.

It is used to assess whether there are significant differences in means over the repeated measurements, under the assumptions of sphericity and normal distribution.\nIn this example, the diameter of \\(n = 20\\) drive shafts is measured after three different steps.\n\nBefore Machining\nAfter Machining\nAfter Inspection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.46: The raw data for the repeated measures ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, outliers are identified. There is no strict rule to identify outliers, in this case a classical measure is applied according to \\(\\eqref{outlierrule}\\)\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{outlier} &=\n\\begin{cases}\nx_i & &gt;Q3 + 1.5 \\cdot IQR \\\\\nx_i & &lt;Q1 - 1.5 \\cdot IQR\n\\end{cases}\n\\label{outlierrule}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  timepoint        Subject_ID diameter is.outlier is.extreme\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;lgl&gt;     \n1 After_Inspection 15             12.9 TRUE       FALSE     \n\n\n\n\nA check for normality is done employing the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro and Wilk 1965).\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\ntimepoint\nvariable\nstatistic\np\n\n\n\n\nAfter_Inspection\ndiameter\n0.968\n0.727\n\n\nAfter_Machining\ndiameter\n0.954\n0.456\n\n\nBefore_Machining\ndiameter\n0.968\n0.741\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to check the dataset for sphericity, meaning to compare the variance of the groups among each other in order to determine the equality thereof. For this the Mauchly Test for sphericity is employed (Mauchly 1940).\n\n\n     Effect     W     p p&lt;.05\n1 timepoint 0.927 0.524      \n\n\nWith \\(p&gt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) \\(H_0\\) is accepted, the variances are equal.

Which groups are different is then determined using a post-hoc test, including a correction for the significance level (Bonferroni 1936).\n\n\nIn this case, the assumptions for a t-test are met, the pairwise t-test can be used.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\ngroup1\ngroup2\nn1\nn2\nstatistic\ndf\np\np.adj\nsignif\n\n\n\n\nAfter_Inspection\nAfter_Machining\n19\n19\n0.342\n18\n0.736\n1.000\nns\n\n\nAfter_Inspection\nBefore_Machining\n19\n19\n−4.803\n18\n0.000\n0.000\n***\n\n\nAfter_Machining\nBefore_Machining\n19\n19\n−6.283\n18\n0.000\n0.000\n****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith \\(p&lt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) \\(H_0\\) is rejected for the comparison Before_Machining - After_Machining and After_Inspection - Before_Machining. It can therefore be concluded that the machining has a significant influence on the diameter, whereas the inspection has none.\n\n\n\n\n4.15.6 Friedman test\n\n\nThe Friedman test is a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman 1937). It is utilized when dealing with non-normally distributed data and multiple measurements within the same subjects. This test helps determine if there are significant differences in medians over the repeated measurements.\nThe same data as for the repeated measures ANOVA will be used.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n.y.\nn\nstatistic\ndf\np\nmethod\n\n\n\n\ndiameter\n20.000\n16.900\n2.000\n0.000\nFriedman test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \\(p&lt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) \\(H_0\\) is rejected, the timepoints play a vital role for the drive shaft parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBartlett, Maurice Stevenson. 1937. “Properties of Sufficiency and Statistical Tests.” Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

It starts with initial coefficients and calculates the gradient of the cost function, representing the error. The coefficients are then updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, with the magnitude of the update controlled by a learning rate. This process is repeated until convergence, gradually refining the coefficients to improve the accuracy of the linear regression model.\n\n\n5.1.3 Model Evaluation and Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: The linear regression between rounds per minute (rpm) of the lathing machine and the diameter of the drive shaft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient of determination (\\(r^2\\)), is a statistical measure that assesses the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a regression model. It ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), where \\(0\\) indicates that the model does not explain any variability, and \\(1\\) indicates that the model explains all the variability. In other words, \\(r^2\\) provides insight into the goodness of fit of a regression model, indicating how well the model’s predictions match the observed data.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nr^2 = 1- \\frac{RSS}{SSE} \\label{r2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe adjusted coefficient of determination, is a modification of the regular \\(r^2\\) in regression analysis. While \\(r^2\\) assesses the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables, the \\(r^2_{adjusted}\\) takes into account the number of predictors (\\(k\\)) in the model, addressing potential issues with overfitting according to \\(\\eqref{r2adj}\\).\nThe \\(r^2_{adjusted}\\) incorporates a penalty for adding unnecessary predictors that do not significantly contribute to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. This adjustment helps prevent an inflated \\(r^2\\) when including more predictors, even if they don’t improve the model significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: The influence of k (number of predictors) on \\(r^2\\) and \\(r^2_adjusted\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nr^2_{adjusted} = 1 - (1-r^2)\\frac{n-1}{n-k-1} \\label{r2adj}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = diameter ~ rpm, data = drive_shaft_rpm_dia)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.89501 -0.19690 -0.01096  0.21917  1.00742 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted values, and their randomness or lack of discernible pattern suggests that the model is effectively explaining the variance in the data. A visible pattern in residuals could indicate that the model fails to account for certain patterns or trends, suggesting potential shortcomings or misspecifications in the regression model. Detecting and addressing such patterns in residuals is crucial for ensuring the validity and reliability of the linear regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: There should not be a visible pattern in the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: The resiuals should be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linear regression, the assumption of normally distributed residuals is essential for accurate statistical inference, parameter estimation using ordinary least squares, and constructing reliable confidence intervals. Normal residuals indicate that the model appropriately captures data variability and helps identify issues like heteroscedasticity. While departures from normality may not always invalidate results, adherence to this assumption enhances the model’s robustness and reliability. If consistently violated, alternative modeling approaches or transformations may be considered.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Hypostesis testing in linear regression\n\nNull Hypothesis (H0): \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: The significance of model parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.500\n0.141\n17.779\n0.000\n\n\nrpm\n0.010\n0.000\n67.895\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linear regression, t testing of coefficients assesses whether individual regression coefficients significantly differ from zero, providing insights into the significance of each predictor’s contribution to the model.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: The significance of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\nadj.r.squared\nstatistic\np.value\ndf\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n0.902\n0.902\n4,609.692\n0.000\n1.000\n498.000\n500.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linear regression, the F-test assesses the overall significance of the regression model by comparing the fit of the model with predictors to a model without predictors, helping determine if the regression equation explains a significant proportion of the variance in the dependent variable.",

An interesting effect is visible for a gradient of \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\): The function becomes a constant which only depends on the intercept (in this case \\(\\beta_0=1\\)).\n\n\n\n5.3.3 \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = -5 \\ldots 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.16: The influence of different paramters for the sigmoid function\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the parameter study is expanded to negative values of \\(\\beta_1\\) (\\(\\beta_1 = -5 \\ldots 0\\)) the curve is mirrored and reverses its direction (see Figure 5.16), which is also highlighted by the reference shape for \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\) in light gray. The general interpretation for the influence of this parameter is reversed by stays the same: the larger the deviation from \\(0\\) is for \\(\\beta_1\\), the more pronounced the S-like shape becomes.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 \\(\\beta_0 = 0\\ldots 5\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: The influence of different paramters for the sigmoid function\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is to vary the intercept (\\(\\beta_1\\)) of the linear regression function that is “hidden” within the sigmoid function. The reference function for \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\) is again shown in light gray in the background in Figure 5.17. It can clearly be seen, that the intercept in a sigmoid-function setting can be used as a kind of offset. Whilst the curve is exactly \\(0.5\\) at \\(\\beta_0 = 0\\), this intersection can be adapted by modeling the intercept. For \\(\\beta_0 &gt; 0\\) the intersection point becomes \\(&gt;0.5\\).\n\n\n\n5.3.5 \\(\\beta_0 = -5 \\ldots 0\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: The influence of different paramters for the sigmoid function\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reference function for \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\) is again shown in light gray in the background in Figure 5.18. For an intercept \\(&lt;0\\) the intersection point with the xaxis then offsets the curve in the other direction compared with Figure 5.17. For \\(\\beta_0 &lt; 0\\) the intersection point becomes \\(&lt;0.5\\). In both cases the S-shape like characteristic of the sigmoid function is retained.\n\n\n5.3.6 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used for estimating the parameters of a model (Starmer 2022). In this approach, the parameter values are chosen to maximize the likelihood function, which represents the probability of observing the given data under the assumed statistical model. The idea is to find the parameter values that make the observed data most probable.\nIn contrast to the cost function for linear regression \\(\\eqref{mse}\\), \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) in logistic regression is a non-linear function \\(\\eqref{yhatlog}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \\label{yhatlog}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhich is why the Maximum Likelihood Estimator is used.\nUsing the MLE basically means, to try different models (with different model parameters) that maximize the likelihood of the parameters being true. Because it is easier to look for minima (gradient descent), a loss function is formulated that can be used as a loss function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.19: The principle of MLE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n-\\log L(\\theta) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y \\log(\\sigma(\\theta^Tx^i)) + (1-y)\\log(1-\\sigma(\\theta^Tx^i)) \\label{logresloss}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7 Modeling Production Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.20: The data for the logistic regression data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 5.20 the data for the production data. The drive shafts have been rated between PASSand FAIL and the lathing machine feed has been recorded. The question is now, at which feed the drive shafts start to FAIL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: The overview of the logistic regression data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 500\n1\n\n\n\n\nfeed\n19.89 (18.55, 21.40)\n\n\npass_1_fail_0\n\n\n\n\n    0\n256 (51%)\n\n\n    1\n244 (49%)\n\n\n\n1\nMedian (Q1, Q3); n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5 shows an overview of the logistic regression data. PASS and FAIL are fairly similar distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.6: The modeling of the logisitic regression data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nlog(OR)\n1\n95% CI\n1\np-value\n\n\n\n\nfeed\n0.46\n0.35, 0.57\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n1\nOR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model coefficients are shown in Table 5.6. Translated in equation \\(\\eqref{logregor}\\) and \\(\\eqref{logrege}\\) we can see, what has been computed.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\log(\\frac{P}{1-P}) &= -9.17 + 0.46x \\label{logregor} \\\\\n\\frac{P}{1-P} &= e^{-9.17 + 0.46x} \\label{logrege}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTherefore the models explains what the odds \\(\\frac{P}{1-P}\\) are for a drive shaft to be FAIL or PASS for a given feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.21: The probability (odds) for a drive shaft being PASS or FAIL for a given feed\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.21 shows the probability for a drive shaft PASS or FAIL for a given feed as well as the confidence interval of the odds ratio for any given feed. For example the probability for PASS at a feed of 20 is \\(49 \\%\\) with a confidence interval of \\(44\\%\\) to \\(54\\%\\).\n\n\n\n5.3.7.0.1 residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.22: Are the residuals of the model normally distributed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.1 Mc Fadden \\(R^2\\)\nMcFadden’s \\(R^2\\) is a measure used to evaluate the goodness of fit for logistic regression models and is calculated using \\(\\eqref{mcfadden}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR^2 = 1- \\frac{\\log(L_{model})}{\\log(L_{null})} \\label{mcfadden} = 0.1198876\n\\end{align}\\]\nIt compares the model to the null-model. It is much smaller then the coefficient of determination with value ranging between \\(0.2 \\ldots 0.4\\) already indicating a good model fit in practice.\n\n\n5.3.7.2 Confusion Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.23: A confusion matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It provides a detailed breakdown of the actual versus predicted classifications, enabling the calculation of various performance metrics. The matrix is particularly useful for binary and multiclass classification problems.\nOn the x-axis usually the ground truth is depicted whereas on the y-axis the predictions of the algorithm are shown. From this several performance metrics can be calculated.\n\n\nTrue Positive (TP): The number of positive instances correctly classified as positive.\nFalse Positive (FP): The number of negative instances incorrectly classified as positive (also known as Type I error).\nTrue Negative (TN): The number of negative instances correctly classified as negative.\nFalse Negative (FN): The number of positive instances incorrectly classified as negative (also known as Type II error).\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.1 Accuracy\n\\[\\frac{TP + TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}\\]\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe ratio of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) to the total instances.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the model. It indicates the proportion of total predictions that were correct. While accuracy is useful, it can be misleading in cases of imbalanced datasets where one class is more frequent than the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.2 Precision\n\\[\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\\]\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe ratio of true positive instances to the total instances predicted as positive.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nPrecision, also known as positive predictive value, measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It is the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. High precision indicates a low false positive rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.3 Recall\n\\[\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\\]\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe ratio of true positive instances to the total actual positive instances.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nRecall measures the model’s ability to correctly identify all positive instances. It is the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positive instances. High recall indicates a low false negative rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.4 Specificity\n\\[\\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\\]\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe ratio of true negative instances to the total actual negative instances.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nSpecificity measures the model’s ability to correctly identify negative instances. It is the proportion of correctly identified negative instances out of all actual negative instances. High specificity indicates a low false positive rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.5 F1 Score\n\\[2\\times\\frac{Precision\\times Recall}{Precision + Recall}\\]\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe F1 Score combines precision and recall into a single metric. It provides a balance between the two, particularly useful when you need to take both false positives and false negatives into account. The F1 score is especially helpful when the class distribution is uneven or when you seek a balance between precision and recall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.2.6 Summary on metrics\n\nAccuracy is best for overall performance but can be misleading for imbalanced datasets.\nPrecision is crucial when the cost of false positives is high.\nRecall is important when the cost of false negatives is high.\nSpecificity complements recall, providing insight into the true negative rate.\nF1 Score offers a balanced measure, useful when both precision and recall are important.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.3 Confusion Matrix in practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.24: Confusion matrices at different probability thresholds\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.24 shows three different confusion matrices at different probability threshold for the logistic regression model and the respective True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative rates. On the x-axis the reference is depicted and the true classes, being \\(0\\) for FAIL and \\(1\\) for PASS parts. The y-axis shows the prediction of the respective model with the classes again being \\(0\\) for FAIL and \\(1\\) for PASS. The probability threshold \\(P = 0.3 \\ldots 0.7\\) is the classification threshold of the model. The logistic regression model computes a Probability based on the Predictor variable (feed). This threshold then classifies the product as pass or fail\n\n\n5.3.7.4 Accuracy, correct classification rate, proportion of correct predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.5 Precision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.6 Recall, True positive rate, sensitivity, hit rate, detection rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.7 Specificity, true negative rate, selectivity, true negative fraction, 1 - false positive rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.8 F1 Score, harmonic mean of precision and recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.9 Receiver Operator Curve (ROC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7.10 METRICSSS!!!!!",
